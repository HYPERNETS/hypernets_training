Without a Google account it may be possible to run the notebook, but this could require further installations by the user (e.g. conda environment).\n","SKILLS REQUIREMENTS:\n","Very basic experience with python and jupyter notebooks (or Google colab) would be helpful. Programming experience in python would be needed to go beyond the exercise (optional extra questions, user curiosity-driven questions), but for the basic exercise this can be done without programming experience.\n","SOURCE:\n","This exercise was developed by Kevin Ruddick and Anabel Gammaru using PANTHYR and HYPSTAR® data from RBINS and VLIZ sites in Belgian waters with instrument, calibration and processing support from the HYPERNETS team.\n","Documentation on creation (hardware, data acquisition, data processing, etc.) of the WATERHYPERNET data used here can be found in [Ruddick et al, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/frsen.2024.1347520].\n","VERSION:\n","Presented at VHRODA_2024-12-04\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sn6be5tnVf66"},"source":["**Q1.** The WATERHYPERNET instrument systems measure downwelling irradiance (Ed), downwelling sky radiance (Ld) and upwelling water + air/water interface radiance (Lu).

HYPSTAR® data is spectrally not as smooth as the PANTHYR data (which could be advantageous for some use cases). Why is that?
